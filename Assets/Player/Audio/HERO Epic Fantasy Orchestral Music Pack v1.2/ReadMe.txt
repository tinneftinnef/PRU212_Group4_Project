- HERO: Epic Fantasy Orchestral Music Pack by Chris Kohler -

Thank you for downloading this music pack!

How to use this pack?
All loop audio tracks are already cut to loop seamlessly. When a track has two files (a and b). Track a (no reverb tail, sometimes with a little intro) is to be played first. Track b is to be played second right after track a and can be looped indefinetely, because it contains the reverb tail. 

What is the reverb tail and why do we need it?
In short: If you're alright with a little bit of imperfection you can only use the b track and just loop it. This will save you some programming.

The reverb tail is there for a realistic and seamless transition from the end to the beginning of the loop. If only track b was to be played, right in the beginning you would hear reverb from music that has not been played before. For some tracks this might go unnoticed, but for others, especially the louder ones, this is audible. Without the reverb tail however, there would be a unnatural absence of sound everytime the loop starts over. This is why for a truly seamless loop you need two audio files for each track. 

Using the variations
The variations are marked with '(less energy)' and their own sub-number (e.g. '04.2' or '07.2'). They can for example be used as alternate tracks or for crossfading with the full orchestra version when something particular in game happens (for example the beginning of a fight).


If you have any questions or issues with the music pack feel free to contact me. I am also available to compose custom music for your game.

I wish you great success with your game project!
